*Instructions:*

Create a new PHP file. Name it whatever you wish.

In it, create variables to store your first name, last name, and birth year.

Create a variable to store your full name, and construct it from your first and last name.

Calculate your age and store it in a variable.

Print the following to the screen as separate lines:

--"My name is {{ NAME }}."

--"I'm {{ AGE }} years old."

Run your program from the command line. Make sure everything prints on separate lines. (edited)

==================================================

Instructions

Open your solution to the last exercise.

Where you print your name, if it's longer than 12 characters, print: "It's a long name". Otherwise, print: "It's a short name".

Use str_repeat to print a line of separators, like "=". Check the docs: http://php.net/manual/en/function.str-repeat.php

After printing "I am {{ AGE }}", if you're older than 21, print: "Sake! Sake! Sake!". If you're younger than 21, print: "No Sake for me :(". Otherwise, print: "Just slipped by! Sake! Sake! Sake!"
