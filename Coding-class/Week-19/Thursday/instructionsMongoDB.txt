1. Installing MongoDB on Windows
Go to the MongoDB download page: MongoDB Download Center

DO NOT Install Compass along with your MongoDB install.

Scroll down, go to the green box with the Community Server Tab highlighted.

Go to the dropdown menu labeled "Version." Select "Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit and later, with SSL support," then click the "DOWNLOAD (msi)" button.

The next page will thank you for downloading MongoDB then show a newsletter link. You can ignore this. In a few seconds, your browser will notify you that the file is downloading.

Open up Windows Explorer and locate the installation file (it should be in the default directory where your browser stores downloads). Open the file and follow the instructions.

When the installer prompts you to "Choose Setup Type," click the Complete button, then carry on.

A window might pop up mid-installation, asking you whether you’re sure you want to download a particular component of MongoDB. Click yes, otherwise the install will fail.

2. Configuring MongoDB on Windows
IMPORTANT: You need to create a data directory for your MongoDB installation, or it won't run. Open Git Bash, then cd your way to the root directory:

cd c:

Run the following command:

mkdir -p data/db

This is the default location for MongoDB’s databases. You need a directory for your databases, or else you MongoDB will refuse to run.

You’ll also want to add MongoDB’s path to the PATH environment variable, so that you can run it easily from the bash command line.

First, locate the directory where you installed MongoDB. This is likely C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\<version_number>\\bin. Copy this directory to your clipboard.

Then, open up the System menu or Control Panel on your machine, usually accessible via the Start menu or Search Bar in Windows operating systems.

Go to Advanced Settings.

If you are on Windows 10 and opened the Control Panel, click System and Security; System; and Advanced System Settings.
When a new window opens up, click the Environment Variables button located toward the bottom of the window.

An Environment Variables window should open up. Look at the bottom half of this window, a scrollable table called "System Variables." Look at the Variable column and search for the variable called Path. Click on it, then click the "Edit…" button below.

The next window will look different depending on your version of Windows. You’ll either be able to press the "New" button and paste your MongoDB directory into the input box that shows up, or you’ll have to paste the directory at the end of a long string of other directories. So it goes.

If you would prefer video instructions for this part, watch this: Youtube Link

Test if it worked: Close your current Git Bash window, then reopen it and run this command: mongod

NOTE: No "b" at the end, simply mongod

If mongod is still running, great job! You’ve installed MongoDB. Your instructor will take it from here.

If mongod didn’t run, and instead your bash threw a "command not found" error, make sure you added MongoDB’s bin directory to your PATH variable (see step B.3). Then, close out git bash and try running mongod again.

If mongod starts but closes after a series of prompts, make sure you created the data/db directory in your root. MongoDB cannot run without this directory (see steps 2.1-2.2).

If you’re still encountering issues starting mongod, please ask for assistance from one of the TAs or the instructor.

3. Installing MongoDB on MacOS
Run the following command in terminal:
brew install mongodb --with-openssl
4. Configuring MongoDB on MacOS
IMPORTANT: You need to create a data directory for your MongoDB installation, or it will not work.

Use the following exact commands (see note below if you want to know what these do):

sudo mkdir -p /data/db

sudo chown -R $USER /data/db

sudo chmod go+w /data/db

With the data/db directory made, you're ready to run MongoDB. Enter this command in your terminal window: mongod

NOTE: No "b" at the end, simply mongod

If mongod didn’t exit from your window, great job! You’ve installed MongoDB. Your instructor will take it from here.

If mongod starts but closes after a series of prompts, make sure you created the data/db directory in your root directory, MongoDB cannot run without this directory (see steps 4.1-4.2).

If you’re still encountering issues starting mongod, please ask for assistance from one of the TAs or the instructor.

If you do not want to use homebrew, you can alternatively follow these instructions: https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/. However, installing MongoDB without homebrew can be a bit of a headache. Installing homebrew on your mac will make your life as a web developer a ton easier.

The commands in #2 create a directory with administrative privileges, make your account the owner of that directory (instead of the "root" account owning it), and add write permissions to that directory so the apps you write are able to update your database


================================================

*Starting with Mongo*

*Instructions*

A. Use the command line to create a classroom database. Insert entries for yourself and the people in your row in a students collection. Each document should have:

1. A field of name with the person's name.
2. A field of rownumber which will contain the row number that they are in.
3. A field of os which will contain the Operating System of the computer they are using: 'Mac', 'Win', etc
4. A field of hobbies with an array of the hobbies the person likes to do.

B. Use find commands to get:

1. A list of everyone in your row.
2. An entry for a single person.
3. The entries for all the Mac users in your row.

*BONUS*

If you finish early, check out the MongoDB documentation and figure out how to find users by an entry in an array.



======================================================


*04-Student-Update-Delete-and-Drop Instructions*

Go back to your classroom database.

You've decided to take on a new hobby. Add Extreme Basket Weaving to your array of hobbies.

While practicing for your Extreme Basket Weaving Competition, you broke the computer of the person next to you. They're using a new Operating System now. Change their os field.

Another student in your row saw you break that computer and wisely decided to move. Remove them from your database.

You are worried everyone else will leave and you'll have to sit all alone. You decide to bribe everyone who didn’t leave with candy. Add a field of gavecandy with a value of false to everyone in the array so you can keep track.

All this work made you hungry, so you bought yourself some candy. Change the value of gavecandy to true in your entry.
